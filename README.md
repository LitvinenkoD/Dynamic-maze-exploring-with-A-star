# Maze Explorer Project

## Main Files
- **maze-explorer.py**: Main script to run the maze exploration.
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for:
  - Visualizing the matrix
  - Generating the maze
  - Other helper functions

## Current State
✅ Maze is generated  
✅ Maze is visualized  

## To-Do List
### Algorithm Implementation
- [ ] Solve the maze using **Repeated A*** and other **A*** methods (e.g., backward solution) *(Max, Angel)*
- [ ] Visualize the solution *(Daniil)*

### Theoretical Analysis
- [ ] Answer theoretical questions, report observations *(TBD)*

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] **LaTeX Report** for extra credit *(Daniil)*
